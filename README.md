# Background
***
In DC, there are  buildings that are rent-stabilized and not, where in the first one rent cannot be raised beyond certain limits. In this project we are going to answer the following research questions in DC:
  * Comparing two bedrooms and one bedrooms in a geographic location.
  * We also created a horizontal bar graph using tabula the data consisting of price of bedroom with different facilities.

# Data Set
***
### Limitation: Price of the residentials is skewed.
### Data is hard to clean.

# Project Result
***
### When we compare two bedrooms and one bedrooms in a DC  geographic location the following result created.

In the above map the darker dot is representing the two bedrooms in the District and the lighter dots are single bedroom.

### The horizontal bar graph for data consisting of price of bedroom with different facilities will be as follow using tabulo.

1. Start by forking this repository to your Github account (click "Fork" in the top right).
Then clone the forked version of the repository to your computer using the URL listed under "Clone or Download".
```
$ git clone <url-of-your-fork>
```
2. We use a triangular workflow - you should push to your Github account's fork, but fetch/pull from this master repository. Setting this up requires adding a remote to this repository account. "Git clone" will have created your repository in a new folder called "dyno_data". Use these commands to add the remote to that new folder:
```
$ cd
$ git remote add  https://github.com/mrkem598/dyno_data.git
$ git remote -v
  #you should see this:
  dyno_data       https://github.com/mrkem598/dyno_data.git (fetch)
  dyno_data       https://github.com/mrkem598/dyno_data.git (push)
  origin          <your/forked/url> (push)
  origin          <your/forked/url> (fetch)
```
3. Commit and push your code to your forked repository with the following commands:
```
$ git add <your_filename> # adds the filename for tracking in your Git repository
$ git commit # a text editing software will popup and you can add a commit message there
$ git push origin master # push your commit from Git to Github
```
